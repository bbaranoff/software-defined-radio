# SDR

**SDR (Software Defined Radio)** is a radio system where most radio functions (like tuning, demodulation, decoding) are handled by software, not dedicated hardware. This makes one device capable of emulating many types of radios—just by running different code. It’s flexible, cheap, and widely used for everything from FM listening to GSM hacking and spectrum analysis.
