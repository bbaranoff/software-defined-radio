# English - SDR Blackbook – Field Notes & Hacks

> _Welcome to the underbelly of radio networks.
> This is where theory meets street-level hacking, and everything is reproducible—if you dare._

**Abstract**

This is a raw and open guide for those who want to actually **build**, **break**, and **understand** wireless networks from scratch.

- **Edge to core:** From sniffing GSM/EDGE with a $20 USB dongle to spinning up your own virtual cell tower in an afternoon.
- **Crypto, not crypto-myth:** Crack A5/1 the way real attackers do. Learn what the protocols really leak.
- **Open hardware, open mind:** OsmocomBB, SDR dongles, GPU attacks—zero NDA, zero gatekeeping.
- **Every script, every hack:** Runs on real gear. No screenshots of vaporware. Every tutorial = tested in the field.

If you’re tired of PDF “whitepapers” and YouTube clickbait, you’re in the right place.
