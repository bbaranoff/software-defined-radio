# The evolution from 2G to 3G: the mobile internet revolution

## Introduction

The transition from 2G to 3G marks a major turning point in the history of mobile telecommunications. While 2G (GSM) democratized voice and SMS, 3G opened the way for mobile internet, multimedia, and the rise of the smartphone.

## 1. 2G: the digital era, voice and SMS

* Launched in the 1990s, 2G (GSM) was the first fully digital standard.
* Key advances:

  * Improved call quality compared to analog (1G)
  * Introduction of encryption (A5/1, A5/2)
  * SMS (short messages), first mobile data via GPRS/EDGE
  * Limited data rates: from 9.6 kbps (GSM) up to \~236 kbps (EDGE)

Limitation: 2G was designed mainly for voice; data was secondary and mobile internet access was very slow.

## 2. 3G: mobile internet for everyone

* Introduced in the early 2000s, 3G (UMTS/WCDMA) aimed to make web browsing, video calls, and mobile downloads possible.
* Technical breakthroughs:

  * Switch to packet-switched data (native data services)
  * Much higher data rates: up to 384 kbps on the move, then several Mbps with HSDPA (3.5G)
  * New services: video calling, mobile web, instant messaging, mobile applications
  * Stronger security: improved encryption (KASUMI/A5/3)
  * International roaming and number portability

## 3. Key innovations introduced by 3G

| Aspect        | 2G (GSM)          | 3G (UMTS/WCDMA/HSPA)               |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Max data rate | \~236 kbps (EDGE) | 384 kbps (UMTS) → 42 Mbps (HSPA+)  |
| Native data   | No (added later)  | Yes (designed for data)            |
| Voice         | Circuit-switched  | Circuit, then VoIP with HSPA+      |
| Security      | A5/1, A5/2        | KASUMI/A5/3, mutual authentication |
| Apps/services | SMS, MMS          | Web, video, apps, cloud            |
| Mobility      | 2G roaming        | Global roaming + seamless handover |

## 4. Limitations of 3G and the move to 4G

* 3G is still “hybrid”: voice is not fully IP-based, latency remains high (>100 ms), and speeds vary by coverage.
* From the 2010s onwards, 4G (LTE) takes over with “all-IP”, VoLTE, and 10x higher data rates.

## Conclusion

The move from 2G to 3G transformed usage patterns: mobile internet, multimedia, and applications became the core of mobile. 3G was the launchpad for the smartphone era and the connected world: without it, there would be no iPhone, no app stores, and no mobile social networks.

Bottom line: 2G enabled communication everywhere; 3G made the internet available everywhere.
