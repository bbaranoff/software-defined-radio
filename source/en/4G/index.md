## Overview of Each Stack

### srsRAN (formerly srsLTE)

* **Description:** Complete software suite (eNodeB, EPC, UE) for LTE (4G) and NR (5G), widely used for research and prototyping.
* **Highlights:** Easy to install (official PPA available), good documentation, SDR support, works for both 4G/5G, standalone or integrated use.
* **Typical use:** eNodeB, EPC, software UE, network analysis, security testing, SDR PoC.

### OpenLTE

* **Description:** More minimal project, focused on LTE reception, signal decoding, and SDR experimentation.
* **Highlights:** Ultra-lightweight, simple for decoding cellId and LTE demo, less suited for full deployments.
* **Typical use:** LTE signal decoding, cellId identification, spectrum analysis, SDR demos.

### OpenAirInterface (OAI)

* **Description:** Highly complete telecom research platform (4G, 5G), supporting eNodeB, EPC, gNodeB.
* **Highlights:** Architecture faithful to 3GPP standards, many modules, strong academic community.
* **Typical use:** Research, advanced core+RAN tests, multi-cell experimentation, up-to-date 3GPP protocol implementation.

### Open5GS

* **Description:** Open source core network EPC (LTE/4G) and 5GC (5G), modern API, highly modular.
* **Highlights:** Core only (no RAN), easy to integrate with 3rd-party eNodeBs (srsRAN, OAI, etc.), supports Docker/K8s, REST API.
* **Typical use:** LTE/5G core deployments, private network integration, standalone or mixed core testing, network application development.
